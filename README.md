# PDF_Reader LINUX VERSION

It basically reads you any PDF (language: English) that you have in your device. 
We can specify several facts about reading like:
a. We can select, from which page reading should start.
b. We can make reading faster or slower as per our need.
c. In case of voice selection, Linux version is not as much efficient than Windows PDF_Reader version.

We can use it anytime anywhere.
